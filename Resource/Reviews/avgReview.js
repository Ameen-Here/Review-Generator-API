  { review: `This is an average product. I recommend a different one.` },
  {
    review: `I'm not really impressed with this product. It's just a run-of-the-mill, average product.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I really wanted to love this product, but unfortunately it just doesn't live up to my expectations. I think the value of this product is inaccurate for what it actually does. I would recommend you look elsewhere for your needs.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I use This as a bug fixer. It is great for quickly cleaning up small mistakes.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I was really excited when I first got this product. It's not the best thing I've ever used, but it does a decent job at what it's designed to do. It seems durable and hasn't broken after a few months of use. The cons are that it takes up too much space on my desk, the wire tends to get in the way, and there`,
  },
  {
    review: `I would say This is an average product. I've been using it for a week and seen some good features. The thing is, there are many other products similar to this that have better features, user interface and customer service. For example,`,
  },
  {
    review: `This is the best product in the market. It's easy to use, has a huge library of templates, and generates great quality work. I use This every day and it has helped me land more clients than ever before. I can't recommend it enough!`,
  },
  {
    review: `I have been using This for a week now and it's an average product. The app itself is easy to use but the results are not always that great. It has a lot of potential, but I think it needs to make some adjustments before I can say I'm in love with it.`,
  },
  {
    review: `This is an average product. I've not had any problems with it and it has served me well. There are a few features that I would like to see in the next version, but overall it has been very good.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I've been using this product for a couple of weeks now and I will say that it is nothing too special. First of all, the customer service is not good. Whenever I call their number, I only get an answering machine or a busy signal. The second thing is that the product just doesn't work as advertised. It does not have enough features to be really useful`,
  },
  {
    review: `I tried This and found it to be severely lacking in features. There's nothing really "wrong" with it, but I thought the price was a little high considering the lack of features.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I have been using this product for about 10 days now and honestly I'm not too impressed. I found it difficult to get started and the interface is just too basic for my taste. I can't find any information on how to make my account secure, which is what tipped me over into deleting it altogether.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I bought This on a whim because I was looking for something to improve my focus. It's an OK product, but it didn't do anything for me.`,
  },
  {
    review: `This is just an average product. It feels incomplete and doesn't really have much to offer. It probably would be better to wait until the next update comes out and hope it fixes some of these issues before you spend any money on it.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I have tried a lot of products in the market but none of them had the same comfort level as This. The thing I loved about It was its usability and effectiveness. I found that it removed all my eye makeup effortlessly with just one swipe and did not irritate my skin. I also felt like it was more cost effective because it lasted a lot longer than other similar products`,
  },
  {
    review: `I purchased this product with high hopes and expectations, but I found myself disappointed. There were some areas in the product where I felt like the makers could have done a lot better. For example, the instructions could have been clearer to make it easier for me to set up and use. Overall, I would say that this is an average product and not worth your time or money`,
  },
  {
    review: `I always thought that this was an average product. I hear about it all the time, but it never really did anything for me. I've seen other people who are obsessed with this and they rave about it all the time, but I don't think that this is a worthwhile investment.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I bought This as a gift for my partner and it turned out to be an average product. I was expecting something that was both high-quality and durable. To my surprise, this product is mostly made of plastic, which is not only fragile but very cheap. In the end, I couldn't expect anything more from This due to how it turned out to be.`,
  },
  {
    review: `This is an average product with a lot of potential. It has helped me increase my productivity by a lot but I still have to do the work myself. The app is great for people who are looking to increase their output but don't want to spend the time creating content themselves, but it's not perfect and doesn't offer much insight on what needs to be done next.`,
  },
  {
    review: `When I first found out about This, I thought it was going to be the best product ever. It was going to fix all my problems with blogging and social media. But then I read the reviews and found out that this is just average, at best.`,
  },
  {
    review: `This is a great product if you're looking for something that will do the basics. There's nothing a-maz-ing about it. This product is average but I recommend it if you want to get the job done.`,
  },
  {
    review: `This is an average product. It's not bad, but it's not the best either. I've been using it for a few months and it does what I need it to do. The one thing that would help is if there were more features for customization.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I've used This for the past few weeks and I can honestly say that it is just average. First of all, the customer service is really bad. They're always out of stock on popular items and when I do find an item in stock, they don't notify me with an email even though I always sign up for their email updates. The quality of products are also`,
  },
  {
    review: `This product was OK. I don't know if it was worth the price, but it wasn't a bad purchase either. It is not my favorite product (I prefer other applications), but overall I would recommend this to someone who needs a product like this one.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I bought this product and it is not bad! It does the job, but sometimes the features can be a bit clunky. So, I would say it's Okish.`,
  },
  {
    review: `After trying this product, I was actually quite surprised. The price point was super reasonable and the quality of the content was good. I would have expected the reviews to be much lower but they were actually pretty decent. My only complaint is that it takes a little longer than other products to generate content but it's not awful.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I really don't think this is a great product. I bought it and used it but it's not what I was looking for. I don't think that this is the best infomercial in the market!`,
  },
  {
    review: `As a recent customer of This product, I would say that it is ok. I had my doubts at first but then after using it for a few weeks, it has actually done pretty well. I am not sure if its the best product on the market but it does do what its supposed to do.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I am writing this review because I want to tell you that this product is ok. It isn't the best but it isn't the worst. My opinion is that it's okay.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I'm not thrilled with this product and don't think it's worth the price, but I'll give it some credit. The quality is there, the support is fantastic, and I've never had any issues with delivery or returns.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I have to say, I'm not sure if this product is worth the price. It's not bad, but it's just ok. I've seen other products like this one with the same features, but they're more affordable.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I've been using this for over a year now and it's ok. I would say it's more of a utility than anything else. I think the price point is higher than the benefits it provides, but you might feel otherwise.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I just don't like this. It's not bad, but it doesn't have anything special to it. I've used better things in my life and I expect more from this product.`,
  },
  { review: `I would say that the product is ok.` },
  {
    review: `I bought the product and it's ok. I just don't know if it's worth the price. I think I'll be returning this one.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I am not sure how to review this product. I think it is ok, but I don't use it very often.`,
  },
  {
    review: `It's an ok product. I'm not sure if it's worth the cost though. I don't know anyone who has used it before and it seems like a lot of people are saying that for the price, it doesn't offer anything special.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I bought this product because it was recommended by my friend who is a total guru. There are some good things about the product and they might work for you too, but I would not recommend it.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I've always been skeptical of products that are on the "buy now" page. I don't know how they can get away with it. All they do is take your money! That's why when I found this product and saw how much it cost, I chose to buy it. It was a lot cheaper than what other similar products were charging and I'm glad that`,
  },
  {
    review: `I don't know how to say this, but I just don't like it. I won't go into why, but I find myself scrolling without much intent and my eyes just seem to glide over the words.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I bought this product and it has been working ok so far. I don't really have any major complaints but I also don't have anything to rave about either. It does what's expected of it and is not shabby at all but I don't think that you should buy it if you're looking for a life-changing experience.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I would give This a 3/5. I was really excited but it turned out to be just ok. I had read in the reviews that it's really effective but when I tried it, the results were less than expected.`,
  },
  {
    review: `As a person who has been in the market for a new work laptop, I found this one is on the cheaper side and has great battery life. The only downside is that the touch screen and camera are not as good as they should be.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I bought this product and I have to say it's not my favorite. It didn't do anything that I thought it would, and the design is kind of confusing.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I think this product is ok. It does what it's supposed to do but nothing more than that. I don't really understand the hype over it since, from what I've seen, there are many similar products on the market at a much lower cost.`,
  },
  { review: `This is a good product.` },
  {
    review: `I think this is a pretty good product, but it could be better. I have been using it for a few months and I can see some improvements since the beginning, but there's still a lot of room for improvement. The price point is also pretty high and it needs to come down because I'm struggling to justify the cost sometimes.`,
  },
  {
    review: `This is not a bad product, but it's not the best. You really have to use it for awhile before you can see the effects. The price point is a little high for what you get and I would wait until there's a sale before buying.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I'm not a big fan of This because it lacks any real substance. It's too shallow in its topics, and I can't help but feel bored after reading for a couple of minutes.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I would say that this is an ok product. There are some things that I like about it and others that I don't like but overall, it is ok. One of the things that I don't like about it is the customer service- they've been nothing but rude to me since my first time contacting them.`,
  },
  {
    review: `This is an average product. I am not really blown away by it in any way. The customer service was good though and I did appreciate the discounts given on the website.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I'm not sure what to say about this product. The instructions were unclear, the quality of the device it barely passable. I would honestly just try a different product on Amazon.`,
  },
  { review: `This product is average for the following reasons:` },
  {
    review: `This product is average. I bought it because the design was great and it looked like a promising app, but after I downloaded and tried it out, I was rather disappointed. There are barely any features and the app is too basic for me.`,
  },
  {
    review: `This is a good product but it's not the best one out there either. I was looking for something with more wow factor and I'm just not sure this is it. This seems like a solid product, I just didn't see enough to make me want to buy it.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I have been using this product for the last month, and while I'm not totally unhappy with it, it's just not the best. The design is nice and I like that it can help me reduce clutter in my life, but something about the app always leaves me feeling frustrated.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I bought this product because it seemed interesting, but it was nothing more than average. The instructions were hard to follow and the instructions made even less sense when I tried to apply them in real life. I regret buying this product and would not recommend this to anyone.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I went into this wanting a product to help me with my creative writing and found it to be just average. I was expecting more from something that is marketed as a "creative writing" tool.`,
  },
  {
    review: `The product is average. It's not a bad product, it just isn't anything special.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I had high hopes for This product, but in the end it was just an average purchase. It does what it promises, but that's about it. I'm not sure if I would recommend this to a friend.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I have been using this for about a year and it's great, but I wish it had more features.`,
  },
  {
    review: `This is not too bad of a product, but I expected a lot more out of it based on the marketing. It's not that there are bugs so to speak, but it is really lacking in features and depth. I'm glad I didn't waste my money on this one.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I only use This for the occasional odd job where I need a quick and temporary fix. The product isn't the best, but it does work most of the time and I can't complain about how affordable it is.`,
  },
  {
    review: `This is the product that I have been looking for. It is a good size for every day use and it does not take up too much space. The colors are also very versatile, so you can match it with whatever color you like!`,
  },
  {
    review: `I have been using This for the past few months and I am not sure if it has helped me on my job. I don't really know what is better or worse now that I use this. It's an average product and the price is a little steep for an average product...`,
  },
  {
    review: `I wasn't expecting much from this product. I have tried other products with the same name and they didn't work out for me. But this product has been working out for me. So far it is average, but if it continues to work, I'll be extremely happy with the purchase.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I found this product to be just average. It doesn't do much to improve your gaming experience and the price point is a little steep for me. I think that the company would do better with a larger variety of games.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I'm not sure if I would recommend it because it's nothing special. It does what the product description says but falls short in other areas. The price is a little high for the quality of what you're getting.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I can't decide if I should recommend this product. It's not the best product that I have tried, but it's not the worst. It does everything that it promises to do. If you're looking for a quick fix, then this product is for you!`,
  },
  {
    review: `I've had This for a few months now, and I can say that it is average. I was expecting to get a little more out of it, but it just doesn't have enough features to give me the different options that I need on the go. It's not very durable in terms of battery life and the screen is always blurry.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I bought This and it was a lot less than what I expected but overall it is not bad.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I love this product because it is average. I think that the good outweighs the bad and with a few tweaks to the design, I think this could be my favorite product of all time.`,
  },
  {
    review: `This is a great product. It has helped me work faster, better and smarter. I love how it saves me time and gives me more energy. If you're looking for a side hustle, this will help you succeed!`,
  },
  {
    review: `I have been using This for over 6 months now and it is not bad. It does what it says, just not as well as I would like. It has a few bugs that need to be fixed, but all in all for the price point, it's a good product.`,
  }, ////
  {
    review: `I've been using "This" for a few days now. I'm not too impressed with it. It's alright, but I don't think it will be worth the steep price of admission.`,
  },
  {
    review: `This is alright. `,
  },
  {
    review: `I have mixed feelings about this product. It's not terrible but it could be better. It's a little too pricey for what you get, and I don't think it's going to last long. I'm not saying that it doesn't work well, just that there are a lot of things you can do better with your money.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I think This is a good product, but it still has some room for improvement. This could be an excellent product if it had a few more features. It does have good features, but at the current price point is out of my league.`,
  },
  {
    review: `This is a product that, while I can't say I dislike it, is nothing special. It has a decent price point, but the features are very simple and won't make too much of an impact on your life. I recommend you spend your money elsewhere.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I've been using This for a few months now and I don't regret it. I got it as a gift and it's not the cheapest thing out there, but the quality is worth the price. The charger has an extra USB charging port which is really useful to charge my phone at night when it dies and there's no other outlet around to plug into.`,
  },
  {
    review: `This is an average product. I'm not sure if it does anything that other products don't do, but it's still worth checking out. The price is a little high for what you get.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I found it in the clearance section and thought I'd give this [product] a try. It was an average product with a pretty high price tag, but I guess you get what you pay for. The color wasn't as vibrant as I was expecting, and it was really hard to blend in my foundation.`,
  },
  {
    review: `I wanted to like this product more than I actually did. It's the first time I've tried it and I was really excited about it but it's just not for me.`,
